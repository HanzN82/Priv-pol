Privacy Policy for YGO-DB

I am just a fan of Yu-Gi-oh!

This application is largely intended for fun only, It is done as a portfolio type of project.

There is no data collection occurring in regards to this application.

The only permission that is needed is the ablility to use the internet. This is because when a card image is loaded, it is currently using a URL to retrieve and display the imnage.

Eventually, the images will be hosted on my own server.

Huge thank you to Konami for administrating this trading card game, and allowing it to exits.

Even Huger thank you to the devs of YGOPRODECK for allowing plebs like me to use their images. Images only appear one at a time when a user searches for and clicks on them.
I don't plan on having IPs get blacklisted.

The whole point of this application is to allow you to search all available cards, and to view their prices on TCGPlayer, and Ebay (with a plan on adding more reputable sites.)

If you end up choosing to use this application, I hope you enjoy it.

I will read any reviews posted on Google Play to see what issues are occurring, and try to improve the app best I can.

I am a software engineer by education, but am very passionate about coding and am just trying to break into the industry professionally
